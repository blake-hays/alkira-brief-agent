# Alkira Knowledge Base — Channel Account Manager Edition

This skill is built for Blake's role as a Channel Account Manager. It's your Alkira reference layer for enabling partners, strategizing on deals, creating partner-facing deliverables, and identifying use cases from real conversations.

## How to Use This Skill

**You are not selling directly to end customers.** You're enabling VAR partners to sell Alkira effectively. That means the skill should help you:

1. **Identify use cases from context** — When Blake shares a call transcript, meeting notes, or describes a partner's customer opportunity (e.g., "Western Midstream is looking at..."), map the situation to Alkira's five solution categories, pull relevant proof points, and suggest how the partner should position Alkira.

2. **Deal strategy** — Help think through how to position Alkira for a specific partner's customer opportunity. What's the entry point? Which use cases apply? What proof points will resonate? What objections should the partner expect?

3. **Partner communications** — Draft emails to partners (not end customers). These might be about deal-specific guidance, Alkira updates, competitive intel, or enablement materials. Tone should be collaborative and peer-to-peer — you're coaching them, not selling to them.

4. **Partner-facing deliverables** — Create cheat sheets, quick reference docs, use case summaries, competitive one-pagers, or other materials that partners can use with their customers.

5. **Competitive & objection support** — When a partner encounters pushback or competitive pressure, provide the right positioning and responses they can use.

When matching tone: you're talking *to partners* about *their customers*. Be direct, practical, and specific. Partners don't need marketing fluff — they need "here's exactly what to say and why."

## Company Overview

Alkira was founded in 2018 by Amir Khan and Atif Khan (deep networking pedigree), launched in 2020, and has raised $176M from Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Google Ventures, Koch Disruptive Technologies, and Tiger Global. Named "Leader" and "Fast Mover" in the GigaOm Radar Report and CRN SaaS/Cloud Startup of the Year.

**Category:** Network infrastructure-as-a-service (NaaS is the broad category; Alkira differentiates as network *infrastructure*-as-a-service)

**Tagline:** Network Infrastructure On-Demand

**Elevator Pitch (for partners to use with their customers):** Alkira is to networking what cloud hyperscalers are to compute and storage. It's the only platform that provides global network infrastructure-as-a-service to connect geographically dispersed users and applications across cloud, data center, and WAN environments — without deploying any physical infrastructure, agents, complex overlays, or configurations. You draw your entire network on an intuitive digital design canvas and deploy it in a single click. No hardware to buy, no software to download, no cloud to learn.

## Target Buyers (Who Partners Should Be Selling To)

**Technical buyers:** Network Architects, Cloud Architects, Security Architects, IT Managers/Directors, CloudOps

**Business decision-makers:** CIOs, CTOs, CISOs, VPs of Infrastructure

**Sweet spot:** Mid-to-large enterprises dealing with cloud migration, multicloud complexity, M&A integration, or network modernization.

---

## The Problem Alkira Solves

Traditional networking can't keep up with the speed, scale, and agility demands of AI workloads, cloud applications, and distributed work. Enterprises end up stitching together point solutions — one for branches, another for remote users, another for cloud, another for security. This creates layers of complexity: disaggregated WANs, multi-cloud networks, distributed security, no consolidated visibility, and lots of hardware. The result is high OpEx, capital-intensive infrastructure, human inefficiency, unnecessary risk, and troubleshooting delays.

Compute and storage are agile. Development is agile. **The network is not.** Alkira changes that.

## Five Core Solution Categories (Entry Points)

These are the five reasons customers buy Alkira. When Blake describes a partner's deal or shares a call transcript, map the customer's situation to one or more of these entry points.

### 1. Hybrid / Single / Multi-Cloud Networking
**Trigger signals:** Customer is migrating to cloud, connecting multiple clouds, moving workloads between providers, or running AI workloads across environments.

Connect anything to anything — network to cloud, within clouds, between clouds, branch offices together. AI workloads aren't constrained by data gravity or a single provider's toolset.

**Key metrics:** 40% cost reduction, 80% faster network provisioning, 96% decrease in cloud connection time.

### 2. Network & Security Services Consolidation
**Trigger signals:** Customer has firewalls everywhere, running different security policies per cloud/VPC, wants to reduce security infrastructure footprint, or is paying too much for firewall licenses.

Move network services from data centers to the cloud. Centrally deploy security services within a region instead of per-VPC/VNET. Leverage the same firewalls for multiple use cases (N-S, E-W, Internet ingress/egress, multi-segment).

**Key metrics:** 73% decrease in firewalls (76 FWs → 14 in one large healthcare account), 44% reduction in network devices.

### 3. Backbone-as-a-Service (MPLS Replacement)
**Trigger signals:** Customer is paying for expensive MPLS circuits, needs low-latency connectivity across regions, shutting down data centers, or looking at SD-WAN migration.

Secure, high-availability, low-latency connectivity across geographic regions on hyperscale cloud infrastructure. Higher performance than MPLS at 40% lower cost, deployed 80% faster. Replaces MPLS, AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute, or Google Cloud Dedicated Interconnect.

### 4. Extranet-as-a-Service (Business Partner / M&A Connectivity)
**Trigger signals:** Customer has M&A activity, needs to onboard business partners, is dealing with overlapping IP address spaces, or needs segmented third-party access.

Point-and-click connectivity with business partners — expose only the applications they need, inspect traffic, get full visibility. For M&A: bring in multiple networks as separate segments with resource-share capabilities. Handles overlapping IP address space.

**Key metric:** 98% reduction in time to onboard a new partner on the extranet.

### 5. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
**Trigger signals:** Customer is implementing zero trust, has distributed remote workforce, or needs per-user access controls.

Secure remote user access based on authentication, authorization, and group-based policies. Per-user segmentation with service autoscaling and pay-per-use pricing.

## How the Platform Works (Quick Reference for Partner Enablement)

**Two core components:**

**Alkira Portal** — The interface (UI, APIs, SDKs, Terraform) for building, deploying, managing, and monitoring the entire network from a single pane of glass. Visio-like click-and-provision experience.

**Cloud Exchange Points (CXPs)** — Network infrastructure-as-a-service fabric nodes. Full-stack networking: Active/Active, Full-Mesh, Routed, HA, deployed in multiple AZs, elastic (scale up/down). CXPs do four things:
1. **Global backbone:** Full-mesh connectivity between CXPs across regions
2. **On-prem & cloud connectivity:** Connect via AWS DX, Azure ER, SD-WAN, IPSec, remote access
3. **Network services insertion:** Deploy services from the Alkira marketplace (Alkira-native + third-party)
4. **Visibility & governance:** See and control how traffic flows across the entire network

**What Alkira is NOT:** Not an orchestration layer. Not software you install in your cloud tenant. Not an overlay. It's a true abstraction layer that leverages cloud providers' infrastructure to deliver network infrastructure as-a-service.

## Key Differentiators (Partner Talking Points)

These are the points partners should hammer when positioning Alkira:

- **Only** comprehensive, entirely virtual network infrastructure delivered as-a-service
- Full-stack networking and security in one platform
- Horizontally and vertically scalable with auto-detect for node/link failure
- End-to-end segmentation and micro-segmentation
- Third-party marketplace for network and security services
- Single-click provisioning of an entire global network
- Zero CAPEX via SaaS-like PAYG, subscription, or ELA options
- No cloud-specific expertise required

## Competitive Positioning

When partners encounter these alternatives at a customer, here's how to position Alkira:

### DIY Cloud Native (AWS Cloud WAN, Azure Virtual WAN)
Manual, complex, single-provider, requires deep cloud expertise, inherits all cloud-native limitations.

### DIY Co-location (Equinix, etc.)
Long provisioning, high CAPEX/OPEX, no automation, no agility, complexity scales exponentially.

### Gateway-based MCN / Orchestration (Aviatrix, Prosimo, Nefeli/Cloudflare)
Agent-based, overlay on cloud native constructs — all limitations still apply. Customers must deploy, manage, maintain, and upgrade infrastructure including scheduled software upgrades. Not true as-a-service.

### Cloud Security Providers (CASB/SWG)
Pure security play — doesn't solve connectivity. Cloud expertise still needed.

**vs. Cato Networks specifically:** Alkira is *inside* the cloud. Cato is not.

**The Alkira difference:** End-to-end enterprise-grade connectivity between on-prem, cloud, and remote users. As-a-service, on-demand, like a virtual Equinix you can spin up in any region in minutes with automatic routing.

## Use Case Identification from Transcripts and Conversations

When Blake shares a call transcript, meeting notes, or describes a partner's customer opportunity:

1. **Identify the customer's situation** — What industry, what infrastructure, what pain points?
2. **Map to entry points** — Which of the five solution categories apply? Often multiple will.
3. **Pull relevant proof points** — Match industry and use case to case studies (see `references/case-studies.md`)
4. **Flag competitive dynamics** — Is there an incumbent? Which competitor category?
5. **Recommend positioning** — How should the partner frame Alkira for this specific opportunity?
6. **Suggest next steps** — What should the partner propose as a next step with the customer?

Be specific. Don't give generic advice. Use the customer's actual situation and map it to Alkira's world.
